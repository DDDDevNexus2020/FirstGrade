# Section 1 Exercise

## Ubiquitous Language
In Domain Driven Design, the term *Ubiquitous Language* refers to the mutually agreed-upon language shared by all members of the business and development teams within a particular business context. A useful tool to discover the language of the business is a **Word Cloud**. 

The **goal** of this exercise is to leverage a word cloud to discover the ubiquitous language of the *First Grade* project.

### Solo Phase (15 minutes)
1)  Skim the [FirstGrade Scenario](https://github.com/DDDDevNexus2020/FirstGrade/blob/master/docs/Scenario.md) that was provided to you.
2)  Navigate to the [WordArt](https://wordart.com/create) web site.
3)  Click the **Import** button.
4)  Copy the entire text of the [FirstGrade Scenario](https://github.com/DDDDevNexus2020/FirstGrade/blob/master/docs/Scenario.md) into the provided dialog box.
5)  Note that common words will be removed, numbers will be removed, and "stemming" (collapsing similar words) will occur.
6)  Click **Import Words**. Then click the red **Visualize** button.
7)  Experiment with removing irrelevant words and re-running the visualization.
8)  Compare the terms that were highest frequency (and size) with the [FirstGrade Scenario](https://github.com/DDDDevNexus2020/FirstGrade/blob/master/docs/Scenario.md) text.

### Team Phase (30 minutes)
1)  Discuss with your team the top words and come to a mutual understanding of their meaning.
2)  Elect a scribe to write/type a "glossary of terms". You may find that the same word is used in a different way in two different contexts of the scenario.
3)  Be prepared to share your definitions with the class.

**IMPORTANT**: Be very careful *not* to inject your own assumptions. Don't infer or invent meanings (or words) that aren't explicitly written in the [FirstGrade Scenario](https://github.com/DDDDevNexus2020/FirstGrade/blob/master/docs/Scenario.md) text.
